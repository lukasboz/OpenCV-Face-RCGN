\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Provides a wrapper for Open\+CV\textquotesingle{}s Face recognizer as well as managing label-\/to-\/name mapping. 

This class is designed to initialize the Open\+CV library\textquotesingle{}s LBPHFace\+Recognizer and load the pre-\/trained model on face data and its corresponding face mapping. When a face is detected, it is passed to the predict method, which returns the predicted label\textquotesingle{}s name and its confidence level.
